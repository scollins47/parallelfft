# Parallel FFT performance analysis
    Performance analysis on parallel variations of the FFT, made by Sammy Collins, Cooper Steinour, and Jacob Hattaway.

## FHT
    The FHT also known as the Fast Hartley Transformation, is a variation of the FFT, that is said to be computational more efficient as there is no need to worry about the inverse of the function as the FHT is its own inverse. To find out more about the FHT, look into the FHT directory to view/run/test our implementation.

## DIT_Rad2
    The Decimation in Time Rad-2 is a variation of the FFT. To find out more about the DIT Rad-2, look into the DIT_RAD-2 directory to view/run/test our implementation.
